get_ipython().set_next_input('1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'them')

Boolean datatypes have two values true & false. we write them as True & False they should start with capital letter


# In[ ]:


get_ipython().set_next_input('2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'operators')

Three types of booleanoperators are
AND
OR
NOT


# In[ ]:


3. Make a list of each Boolean operator(i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

AND OPERATOR  returns  true only if all the inputs are true
    
   A     B      A AND B
FALSE  FALSE     FALSE
FALSE  TRUE      FALSE
TRUE   FALSE     FALSE
TRUE   TRUE      TRUE


OR OPERATOR returns true if any of the input  values is  true

 A       B      A OR B
FALSE  FALSE    FALSE
FALSE  TRUE     TRUE
TRUE   FALSE    TRUE
TRUE   TRUE     TRUE

NOT OPERATOR returns true if the input is false 

  A     NOT A
FALSE    TRUE
TRUE     FALSE

get_ipython().set_next_input('4. What are the values of the following expressions');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'expressions')
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                       # false   
not (5 > 4)                                # false
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                        #true
not ((5> 4) or (3 == 5))                   # false
(True and True) and (True == False)        # false
(not False) or (not True)                  #true

get_ipython().set_next_input('5. What are the six comparison operators');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'operators')
 ==    EQUALS 
 >     GREATER THAN
 <     LESS THAN 
 >=    GREATER THAN OR  EQUAL TO
 <=    LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO
 get_ipython().system('=    NOT EQUAL TO ')

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.

=  IT IS USED TO ASSIGN VALUES THIS IS AN ASSIGMENT OPERATOR
==  (EQUAL) THIS RELATIONAL OPERATOR IS  USED TO  CHECK THE OPERANDS ARE EQUAL ARE NOT 

A = 10  # here we use (=) assignment operator for assigning 10 on right to A

(3 == 5) #  this relational operator  is used to find the relation between two operands and returns in boolen value either 'true' or 'false'

7. Identify the three blocks in this code: 
    
spam = 10
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')    # 1st block
if spam > 5 :
    print('bacon')   # 2nd block
else :
    print('ham')     # 3rd block
    print('spam')
    print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

spam = 1 
if spam == 1 :
    print("Hello")
elif spam == 2 :
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings!")

get_ipython().set_next_input('9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'press')

We can stop the loop by pressing CTRL+C


# In[ ]:


get_ipython().set_next_input('10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'continue')

break and continue are used to skip the iteration of the loop
break statement is used to  terminate whole loop
continue statement  is used to skip the current iteration

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

All the three are same they give output  from 0-9 


# In[38]:


12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

for i in range(1,11) :
    print(i)


# In[37]:


i = 1
while i<11:
    print (i)
    i = i + 1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
get_ipython().set_next_input('importing spam');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'spam')

we can call it by using    spam.bacon()
